# Data Science 团队

+ Project sponsor：代表了商业需求，赞助项目。提供项目目标
+ Client：代表了最终用户，领域专家
+ Data scientist：设定，执行分析战略；与sponsor和client沟通
+ Data Architect：管理存储数据，有时也收集数据
+ Operation：管理基础架构，部署，运营

# Data Science项目

不断循环

+ 目标定义：解决什么问题？
+ 收集与管理数据：需要什么信息？
+ 建立模型：寻找数据的模式
+ 评估与优化模型：模型是否解决了我的问题
+ 展示结果/报告：问题解决情况
+ 模型部署：在真实环境部署

## 目标

以一个[贷款数据为例](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data))

+ Why do the sponsors want the project in the first place? What do they lack, and what do they need?
+ What are they doing to solve the problem now, and why isn’t that good enough?
+ What resources will you need: what kind of data and how much staff? Will you have domain experts to collaborate with, and what are the computational resources?
+ How do the project sponsors plan to deploy your results? What are the constraints that
have to be met for successful deployment?

The goal should be specific and measurable, not “We want to get better at finding bad loans,” but instead,
“We want to reduce our rate of loan charge-offs by at least 10%, using a model that predicts
which loan applicants are likely to default.”

## 数据收集

+ What data is available to me?
+ Will it help me solve the problem?
+ Is it enough?
+ Is the data quality good enough?

当然对于拿到的数据你还需要根据情况修复数据错误，进行数据变换。

## 建模

+ Classification— Deciding if something belongs to one category or another
+ Scoring— Predicting or estimating a numeric value, such as a price or probability
+ Ranking— Learning to order items by preferences
+ Clustering— Grouping items into most-similar groups
+ Finding relations— Finding correlations or potential causes of effects seen in the data
+ Characterization— Very general plotting and report generation from data

```{r}
library('rpart')
load('GCDData.RData')
model <- rpart(Good.Loan ~Duration.in.month +Installment.rate.in.percentage.of.disposable.income +
	Credit.amount +Other.installment.plans,
	data=d,
	control=rpart.control(maxdepth=4),
	method="class")
```

## 模型评估

+ Is it accurate enough for your needs? Does it generalize well?
+ Does it perform better than “the obvious guess”? Better than whatever estimate you currently use?
+ Do the results of the model (coefficients, clusters, rules) make sense in the context of the problem domain?

```{r}
resultframe=data.frame(Good.Load=creditdata$Good.Load,
	pred=predict(model,type="class"))
rtab=table(resulfframe)

```

## 报告

+ How should they interpret the model?
+ What does the model output look like?
+ If the model provides a trace of which rules in the decision tree executed, how do they
read that?
+ If the model provides a confidence score in addition to a classification, how should they
use the confidence score?
+ When might they potentially overrule the model?
